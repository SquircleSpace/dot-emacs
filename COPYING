I wrote most of the code contained in this repository. Anything I
wrote can be used without restriction. The code I have copied /
adapted from various sources is probably okay to use, too. The authors
usually didn't include a license when they published their code
publicly online, but so long as you aren't making money off their
work, they probably won't care. If there was a license, I have tried
my best to keep it with their code.
